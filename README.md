### Hi, I'm Negin 👋
I am an atmospheric scientist and a software engineer who is passionate about adopting emerging computational technologies for improving the performance of weather and climate forecasting models. 

I am particularly interested in improving weather and climate forecasts using artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms. 

I am currently working at the [Computational and Information Systems Lab](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/) at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/). I have a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Iowa and my thesis was focused on optimization of weather and air quality models for different applications.
